* Creating a new rails app
 $rails new blog

* Create a controller - Controller is to receive specific request for the application. Routing decides which controller receives which request.different route can be served by different action in the controller.

$ rails g controller welcome index

the above command will create welcome controller with index action.

*router.rb - this is routing file which holds entries for special DSL and tells Rails how to connect incoming requests to controller and action.

in routes.rb  ==> root "welcome#index"

- tells rails to load this as home page.

* rails provide resource method which provides standard REST resource 

--> resource :posts
 posts GET    /posts(.:format)          posts#index
          POST   /posts(.:format)          posts#create
 new_post GET    /posts/new(.:format)      posts#new
edit_post GET    /posts/:id/edit(.:format) posts#edit
     post GET    /posts/:id(.:format)      posts#show
          PUT    /posts/:id(.:format)      posts#update
          DELETE /posts/:id(.:format)      posts#destroy

* Now we will see how to create a blog form 

 - create an empty controller 
 	$ rails g controller posts
 - when we try to open localhost:3000/posts/new , we will be getting 'Unknown Action' error says action is missing in controller.

 def new

 end

 - when we again try to run the same url now it says 'Template missing'
 	- create a new view file under views/posts/new.html.erb
 	$<h1> Hello RAils</h1>

 	- to create form use 


<%= form_for :post do |f| %>
<p>
	<%=f.label :title %>
	<%=f.text_field :title %>
</p>
<p>
	<%=f.label :text %>
	<%= f.text_area :text %>
</p>
<p>
	<%= f.submit %>
</p>

<% end %>

  - inspect the form action will be 'posts/new' but we need to reidrect to page where all posts are displayed that is done using 'url' option

  	$<%= form_for :post,url: posts_path do |f| %>

  	- the above will change the action to /posts

  + when you c=put some data on the form and click submt button ,it will get redirected to /posts
  	- Unknown create action error occurs

  	- create a create method in controller and add these in controller.

  	
	def create
		render text: params[:post].inspect
	end

    - above will render data in hash format


+ CREATE A MODEL:
  -a model named as LETTER is  created.

  $ rails g model Letter title:string text:text

  - run the migration to create a database and tables.

    $ rake db:migrate

  - if you want to migrate in production environment then use the command.

    $ rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
    
  - since security is higlighted in rails they have asked what do be included while posting the form

   private

  def post_params
    params.require(:post).permit(:title,:text)
  end

  - define show method as form is submited we are redirecting to show action

    def show 
    @post = Letter.find(params[:id])
  end

  - list all the post in index.html using index action 

     def index
    @posts = Letter.all
  end
